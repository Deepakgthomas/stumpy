    "However the question arises, \"what value of $P_{ABBA}$ would best serve as our distance measure?\" The largest value in $P_{ABBA}$ would make the measure sensitive to the slightest outlier in either of the time series. Whereas, the smallest value would essentially consider all time series to be the same irrespective of their attributes. Therefore, the $k^{th}$ smallest number in $sorted$ $P_{ABBA}$ was taken to be the value of MPdist. The authors set this value as 5 percent of sum of the length of both time series.<br><br>\n",
    "However, if the length of the subsequence extracted for comparision via sliding window (for more details, refer tutorial_0) is near the length of the concatenated series, then the $P_{ABBA}$ length reduces lower than 5% of the concatenated length.During such cases, the paper considers the MPdist to equal the maximum value of $sorted$ $P_{ABBA}$."
